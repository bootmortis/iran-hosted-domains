A lot of services and domains are outside of Iran and they are restricted or blocked,
for accessing this service you need to use VPN or proxies with tunneling option, apart from these problems, when we use
proxies the domestic services are unavailable because our IP is not in Iran; for bypassing these issues we gathered a list of
Iranian domains and services to help our people bypass this situation.

## Usage

This can differ depending on which tool you use. You can download the domains list from the [release page][link-release].  
for quick review of all release files see [Files section](#files).  
In v2ray clients you can set Domain Resolution Strategy to `IPIfNonMatch` for better routing.
[more info.](https://www.v2ray.com/en/configuration/routing.html)

### `iran.dat`/`iran-geosite.db` general rules

`iran.dat` can be used in v2fly, v2ray, and xray clients. Similarly, cores related to SingBox can use the `iran-geosite.db` file.

1. Download `iran.dat` file from [here][link-release].
2. Copy/Import the file to your client.
  For example:
    - v2ray macOS: `/usr/local/share/v2ray`

3. Add proper rules:
    - `ext:iran.dat:all` in bypass section
    - `ext:iran.dat:ads` in block section

4. Reconnect.

#### Full categories

- `ir`: handpicked `.ir` domains, use as `direct`.
- `other`: non `.ir` domains, use as `direct`.
- `tld-ir`: all `.ir` domains, use as `direct`.
- `all`: a combination of `other` and `tld-ir`, should be used as `direct`.
- `ads`: Iran-related advertising services that need to be `blocked`.
- `proxy`: Iran-related domains that are blocked inside of iran and need to be `proxied`.

### [NekoBox](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid)

1. Download `iran-geosite.db` file from [here][link-release].
2. Rename it to `geosite.db`
3. Import .db file from `Route -> Three dots -> Manage Route Assets`:
4.  Add proper rules  `Route -> Create Route`:
    - Block Iran Ads:
      - domain: `geosite:ads`
      - outbound: `Block`
    - Bypass Iran Domains:
      - domain: `geosite:all`
      - outbound: `Bypass`
    - Bypass Iran geoip:

## Automatically Updating the `iran.dat` File

Ensuring that you have the latest version of the `iran.dat` file is crucial for accurate filtering of Iranian domains. This section will guide you on how to set up an automated process to update the file on a regular basis.

### Linux

#### Prerequisites

- You should have `curl` and `shasum` installed on your system.

#### Usage

1. Download the [update_iran_dat.sh](scripts/update_iran_dat.sh) script from this repository.
    ```shell
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains/main/scripts/update_iran_dat.sh
    ```
2. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```shell
    chmod +x update_iran_dat.sh
    ```
3. Open your crontab file by running the following command:
    ```shell
    crontab -e
    ```
4. In the crontab editor, add the following line to schedule the script to run every Tuesday (a day after we update `iran.dat`):
    ```shell
    0 0 * * 2 /path/to/update_iran_dat.sh /path/to/iran.dat
    ```
    Make sure to replace `/path/to/update_iran_dat.sh` with the actual path to the script on your system and `/path/to/iran.dat` with the actual path to the `iran.dat` file that you want to update.
5. Save the crontab file and exit the editor.

### Windows

#### Prerequisites

- Since the script is not signed, you must have the appropriate execution policy to run it.
- This can be achieved by running the following command in a Powershell window with administrative rights:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    ```

#### Usage

1. Download the [update_iran_dat.ps1](scripts/update_iran_dat.ps1) script from this repository and move it to your preferred  location (next to `iran.dat` file should be good).

2. Run the Windows command prompt as Administrator and execute the following command:
   ```cmd
   SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC WEEKLY /D TUE /TN "UPDATE IRAN.DAT" /TR "powershell -File '<path\to\update_iran_dat.ps1>' '<path\to\iran.dat>'" /ST 19:00
   ```

    Make sure to replace `<path\to\update_iran_dat.ps1>` with the actual path to the script on your system and `<path\to\iran.dat>` with the actual path to the `iran.dat` file that you want to update. 

The scripts handle the process of updating the `iran.dat` file. They check if the file already exists and compare the checksum of the existing file with the latest version available on the repository. If a new version is available, they download the updated file and replace the existing one. If the local file doesn't exist, they simply download the latest version and save it to the specified path.

**Note:** The script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to write to the directory where the `iran.dat` file is located. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the script has appropriate write permissions or modify the script accordingly.

It is recommended to test the script manually before setting up the cron job or SCHTASK to ensure it executes correctly.


## Create .dat file manually (Tutorial)

### 1. Install [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

It's important to install the right version. Always check it from [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/blob/master/go.mod).

### 2. Clone [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community)

```
git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community
```

### 3. Prepare domains

In a .dat file, you can have as many distinct groups as you want. Each of these groups can be in bypass, proxy or blocked sections. Each group can have as many domains as you want.

Each group is a txt file containing domains. For example, you can have an ads.txt file containing ad domains.

### 4. Move files to /data

When cloning `domain-list-community`, you also clone all the groups that have been there before. Since you don't need them, delete everything in /data directory.

Now you have to copy your files to /data directory. Make sure to remove their file extension. So for example, `ads.txt` needs to be `ads`.

```
cd domain-list-community
rm data/*

cp ~/ads.txt data/ads
```

### 5. Run the program

```
go run ./ --outputdir=../
```

## Files
You can always find the latest version of these files in the [release page][link-release].  
You can click on app name to see the usage instructions.  
Also, for each file there is a `.sha256` file that contains sha256 hash of that file.
