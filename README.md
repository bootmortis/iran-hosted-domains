A lot of services and domains are outside of Iran and they are restricted or blocked,
for accessing this service you need to use VPN or proxies with tunneling option, apart from these problems, when we use
proxies the domestic services are unavailable because our IP is not in Iran; for bypassing these issues we gathered a list of
Iranian domains and services to help our people bypass this situation.

## Usage

This can differ depending on which tool you use. You can download the domains list from
the [release page][link-release].
In v2ray clients you can set Domain Resolution Strategy to `IPIfNonMatch` for better routing.

### [NekoBox](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid)

1. Download `iran-geosite.db` file from [here][link-release].
2. Rename it to `geosite.db`
3. Import .db file from `Route -> Three dots -> Manage Route Assets`:
4.  Add proper rules  `Route -> Create Route`:
    - Block Iran Ads:
      - domain: `geosite:ads`
      - outbound: `Block`
    - Bypass Iran .ir Domains:
      - domain: `domain:.ir`
      - outbound: `Bypass`
    - Bypass Iran non .ir Domains:
      - domain: `geosite:other`
      - outbound: `Bypass`
    - Bypass Iran geoip:
      - ip: `geoip:ir`
      - outbound: `Bypass`
5. Reconnect.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You are replacing default geosite with `iran-geosite.db` by doing this, so you can't use default geosite categories like `category-ads-all`. You can switch back to default geosite by updating `geosite.db` from `Manage Route Assets` section.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you are using older versions add these instead :
```yaml
rule-providers:
  iran_other:
    type: http
    behavior: domain
    url: "https://github.com/bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains/releases/latest/download/clash_rules_other.yaml"

```
> Surfboard ignore update-interval at this moment, consider updating from Tool>External resources

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you are using older Surge versions (before Surge for Mac v3.5.1/Surge for iOS v4.2.2) add these instead:
```INI
RULE-SET,https://github.com/bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains/releases/latest/download/surge_ruleset_ads.txt,REJECT,update-interval=432000
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,ir,DIRECT

GEOIP,IR,DIRECT
```
3. Save the file.
4. Set 'Outbound Mode' to 'Rule-based'.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note : in case that blocked websites are not working with 'Rule-based' mode, consider adding this rule before 'FINAL' rule:
```INI
DOMAIN-KEYWORD,,YourFinalProxy/ProxyGroup,force-remote-dns
```
> Use your own Proxy/ProxyGroup instead of 'YourFinalProxy/ProxyGroup')

üö® You can also use Surge's Rule-Set or Domain-Set in [Loon](https://www.nsloon.com) / [LanceX](https://lancex.org).

## Automatically Updating the `iran.dat` File

Ensuring that you have the latest version of the `iran.dat` file is crucial for accurate filtering of Iranian domains. This section will guide you on how to set up an automated process to update the file on a regular basis.

### Prerequisites

- You should have `curl` and `shasum` installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Download the [update_iran_dat.sh](scripts/update_iran_dat.sh) script from this repository.
    ```shell
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains/main/scripts/update_iran_dat.sh
    ```
2. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```shell
    chmod +x update_iran_dat.sh
    ```
3. Open your crontab file by running the following command:
    ```shell
    crontab -e
    ```
4. In the crontab editor, add the following line to schedule the script to run every Tuesday (a day after we update `iran.dat`):
    ```shell
    0 0 * * 2 /path/to/update_iran_dat.sh /path/to/iran.dat
    ```
    Make sure to replace `/path/to/update_iran_dat.sh` with the actual path to the script on your system and `/path/to/iran.dat` with the actual path to the `iran.dat` file that you want to update.
5. Save the crontab file and exit the editor.

The script `update_iran_dat.sh` handles the process of updating the `iran.dat` file. It checks if the file already exists and compares the checksum of the existing file with the latest version available on the repository. If a new version is available, it downloads the updated file and replaces the existing one. If the local file doesn't exist, it simply downloads the latest version and saves it to the specified path.

**Note:** The script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to write to the directory where the iran.dat file is located. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the script has appropriate write permissions or modify the script accordingly.

It is recommended to test the script manually before setting up the cron job to ensure it executes correctly.


## Create .dat file manually (Tutorial)

### 1. Install [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

It's important to install the right version. Always check it from [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/blob/master/go.mod).

### 2. Clone [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community)

```
git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community
```

### 3. Prepare domains

In a .dat file, you can have as many distinct groups as you want. Each of these groups can be in bypass, proxy or blocked sections. Each group can have as many domains as you want.

Each group is a txt file containing domains. For example, you can have an ads.txt file containing ad domains.

### 4. Move files to /data

When cloning `domain-list-community`, you also clone all the groups that have been there before. Since you don't need them, delete everything in /data directory.

Now you have to copy your files to /data directory. Make sure to remove their file extension. So for example, `ads.txt` needs to be `ads`.

```
cd domain-list-community
rm data/*

cp ~/ads.txt data/ads
```

### 5. Run the program

```
go run ./ --outputdir=../
```

## Files

- **iran.dat:** Contains all websites hosted in Iran and ADs in a special format.
- **domains.txt:** Contains all websites hosted in Iran.
- **qv2ray_schema.json:** Importable json schema that can be used in [Qv2ray](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray).
- **shadowrocket.conf:** Importable conf file that can be used in [Shadowrocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowrocket/id932747118).
